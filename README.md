# Artifical Neural Networks

## Quick Intro

This repository contains the extent of my attempts to learn about neural networks and possibly deep learning through creating (very basic) nets, and observing how they do what they do. 

This started as a project to create basic neural networks.
Once I realized just how difficult and theory-based even the most basic nets are, I looked into finding some ANN/Deep Learning libraries.
After seeing the options that already exist, I've decided that, given the time, I would attempt to write my own library as a personal project to better understand the more intricate workings of perceptrons.
