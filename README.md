# NeuralNetworks

## Intro

This repository contains the extent of my attempts to learn about neural networks and possibly deep learning through creating (very basic) nets, and observing how they function.

Started as a project to create basic neural networks. Once I realized just how difficult and theory-based even the most basic nets are, I looked into finding some ANN/Deep Learning libraries. After seeing the options that already exist, I've decided that, given the time, I will write my own library as a personal project to better understand the more intricate workings of perceptrons.

## Useful(?) Libraries
### Python
- Theano
- PyBrain
- SciKitLearn

### C++
- FANN
- Lightweight NeuralNetwork++
- OpenNN
- NeuroLab

### JavaScript
- Node-FANN
- brainJS
- ConvNetJS
