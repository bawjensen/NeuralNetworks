# NeuralNetworks

## Intro

This repository contains the extent of my attempts to learn about neural networks and possibly deep learning through creating (very basic) nets by hand, and observing how they function.

## Useful(?) Libraries
### Python
- Theano
- PyBrain
- SciKitLearn

### C++
- FANN
- Lightweight NeuralNetwork++
- OpenNN
- NeuroLab

### JavaScript
- Node-FANN
- brainJS
- ConvNetJS
